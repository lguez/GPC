This is the GPC library. GPC means "General Polygon Clipper". The
author is Alan Murta. This is version `2.32`, of 2004. GPC was
distributed on the website of the university of Manchester but it is
no longer available there, since August 2020. There is a [version
2.33](https://github.com/rickbrew/GeneralPolygonClipper) of GPC, of
2014, but version `2.33` calls `fscanf_s`, which is in the extension,
annex K, of C11, implemented by Microsoft only. So we stay with
version `2.32`.
